# About JustCtrl

DPI aware interface for native windows GUI C++ development and custom controls with double-buffering and transparency that can be customized.

Backwards compatible with older versions of windows.
Tested On:
- Windows XP x64 SP2, Visual Studio 2010, CMake 3.13.4

Example program included.
- main.cpp

More examples can be found in the examples folder. You can tell CMake to use a source file in the examples folder instead of using `main.cpp` by passing the `example` argument with the desired example source file. Like this: ```cmake -Dexample=examples/tabmain.cpp```.
